### ✈️ Flight Price Analysis using Python (Pandas & Matplotlib)
## Overview:
Analyzed a real-world flight pricing dataset to uncover trends and patterns in airfare fluctuations across different airlines, routes, and durations.
## Tools Used:
- Python (Pandas): For data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory analysis
- Matplotlib: For visualizing price distributions, airline comparisons, and time-based trends
## Key Highlights:
- Handled missing values and standardized categorical features for clean analysis
- Explored how factors like airline, source/destination city, number of stops, and duration affect ticket prices
- Created insightful visualizations including bar plots, histograms, and line charts to highlight pricing behavior
- Identified high-cost routes and airlines with consistent pricing patterns
